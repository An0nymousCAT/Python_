# Python_
this project is inspired by the basics of pyhton. delete.py deals with using simple codes to perform diffrent actions on tuple, sets, directory, if loop, while loop and etc..
this file can be used by students to learn and run diffrent codes. this file does not have any complex code that deals with database or higher level pyhton using SQL. 
Beginners can use this file and it will mostly help the beginner to execut these codes. 
in this project there are many comments to make it more easy for the reader to understand what is there in the code and for what is the code being used for.
The change done to the document on 04-10-2023 is the most basic. Which has the least number of comments in the document which makes it difficult to read.
Further changes would be done to the document to make it more readable and easy.
Thank you for spending your precious time in reading this document. 👏👏
